# CodeAlpha - Network Sniffer 

This project is a simple **network sniffer** developed in Python using the **Scapy** library.  
It was created as part of a cybersecurity internship with **CodeAlpha**.

The program allows you to:
- Capture live network packets in real time
- Display source and destination IP addresses
- Identify the protocol used (TCP/UDP)
- Show source and destination ports
- Read the packet content (payload), if available

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Scapy 
- Npcap (for real packet sniffing on Windows)

## How to Use
1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**
2. Navigate to the folder containing the script
3. Run the script with: python task1.py
